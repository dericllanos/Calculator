# Calculator
Possible improvements:
- Partially refactored.
- Inputting operators next to each other and then clicking "="; errors handled with alerts and removing last entered character. 
    * Could make it so that clicking operators consecutively replaces the previously tapped operator.
- Allow screen rotation. 

Fixes:
- Percentage and (+/-) buttons fixed to mutate on tap.
- UI constraint warnings fixed.
- Decimal button limited to one click before operation.
- Fixed decimal functionality; String cast to Double.
    * Inputting more than two number ignores the third+ (for now).
