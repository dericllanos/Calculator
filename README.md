# Calculator
Possible improvements:
- Need to refactor redundant code.
- Inputting operators next to each other and then clicking "="; errors handled with alerts. 
    * Could make it so that clicking operators consecutively replaces the previously tapped operator.
- Allow screen rotation. 
- Need to make it so that if string before "." is empty "" is replaced with 0
    * if string after "." is empty "" is replaced with 0

Fixes:
- Percentage and (+/-) buttons fixed to mutate on tap.
- UI constraint warnings fixed.
- Decimal button limited to one click before operation.
