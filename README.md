# Calculator
Possible improvements:
- Need to refactor redundant code.
- Inputting operators next to each other and then clicking "="; errors handled with alerts. 
    * Could make it so that clicking operators consecutively replaces the previously tapped operator.
    * Need to do something similar for ".".
        + Only allow one "." for number string.
        + Separate number strings with operators.

Fixes:
- Percentage and +/- buttons fixed to mutate on tap.
